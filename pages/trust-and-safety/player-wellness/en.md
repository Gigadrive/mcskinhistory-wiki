# Player Wellness

> Player safety and health are important to the staff of MCSkinHistory. However, please understand that the MCSkinHistory staff does not have formal training to provide one-on-one care. This article is a guide to help you or a friend reach out to individuals or organizations who are better equipped to provide assistance and care for mental well-being.

If you are feeling depressed, suicidal, or facing other emotional health challenges, please read further on this page for some sources that can help you or a friend you are concerned for.

If you encounter an issue with another person threatening or harassing you on MCSkinHistory's services, please contact [support@gigadrivegroup.com](mailto:support@gigadrivegroup.com) **immediately**.

## Support

* Family members
  * Parents
  * Siblings
  * Extended family (i.e. Uncle, Aunt, Grandparents, etc.)
* Friends
* Teachers or trusted staff members at educational institutions
* Religious figures or local community group members
* Support group
* Counselors, psychologists, or therapists

* Local law enforcement/Police departments

> For emergency situations, where you or another person is at immediate risk, please contact local emergency services.
