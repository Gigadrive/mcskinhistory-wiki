# Data Removal

As MCSkinHistory is an automatic database, occasionally data owners want their data removed from the database. If you have specific data you want removed from MCSkinHistory, please refer to this page to understand what steps you can take.

## Skins & Capes

Skins & Capes can be removed through MCSkinHistory's self service. After you have [created an account](/help/getting-started/registration) and [linked your Minecraft account](/help/getting-started/linking-your-minecraft-account), you can manually remove Skins & Capes linked to your account with the following steps:

1. [Log in with your MCSkinHistory account.](/login)
2. Click your avatar in the top right corner of the website.
3. Click on the "Edit Profile" option.
4. On the left side of the page, click the type of file you would like to remove. For a Minecraft Skin, click "Skins".
5. Out of the list, find the skin you want to remove and click the "Remove" button.
6. Read the notice that appears in the small popup and make sure you understand it. Afterwards click "Remove" again.
7. Your file has been removed from your profile.

## Names and Minecraft Accounts

MCSkinHistory does not offer removal for these types of data, as they are merely mirroring publicly available data provided by [Mojang's APIs](https://wiki.vg/Mojang_API). This data is publicly available to anybody on the internet and MCSkinHistory merely acts as an interface for this data.

If you contact Mojang about data removal for a name in your name history, MCSkinHistory will automatically remove this data soon after. If you contact Mojang about deleting your Minecraft account altogether, please send an email to [support@gigadrivegroup.com](mailto:support@gigadrivegroup.com) and your Minecraft account will be manually removed from MCSkinHistory's database.

You can contact Mojang's support [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/requests/new).

## MCSkinHistory Accounts & Gigadrive Accounts

MCSkinHistory and Gigadrive accounts may be removed on request. If you want your account removed, please send an email to [support@gigadrivegroup.com](mailto:support@gigadrivegroup.com) with the email address you used for your registration.

## Servers

Occasionally, a server gets added to MCSkinHistory's server list that is not meant to have it's IP address be known to the public. In this case, please send an email to [support@gigadrivegroup.com](mailto:support@gigadrivegroup.com). If you have not claimed your server's page on MCSkinHistory, please include proof that you own the server in question. Your server will then be placed on a blacklist to prevent it from being publicly indexed in the future.

## Anything else

If there is any other data you want to have removed from MCSkinHistory, please send an email to [support@gigadrivegroup.com](mailto:support@gigadrivegroup.com).
